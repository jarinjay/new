AzCopy does not have any explicit limitations based on file type â€” it copies all file types (binary, text, executables, etc.) as long as:

The file is accessible to the process.

The filename and path comply with Azure Storage naming rules.

The total length of the blob name is within limits (1024 characters).

The file isn't locked or in use during transfer.

Common Reasons for AzCopy Failures (like your ~1290 files):
File locks / open files: If files were in use (e.g., by an application), they might have been skipped.

Path length issues: Windows has a max path length (260 chars by default); AzCopy might have trouble reading them.

Special characters in filenames: Certain characters are unsupported or not encoded correctly in URLs.

Permission issues: AzCopy process might not have read access to some files.

Too many small files too quickly: High rate of small file copies can cause throttling or timeouts.

Files added/removed during transfer: If files were changing during copy, mismatches happen.

Storage Account Limits: Not usually a problem unless you're hitting request rate limits (e.g., ingress throttling).

Name conflicts: Files with same name but different casing (on case-insensitive systems) may overwrite or fail.

Symlinks / junctions: Not always handled correctly unless specific flags are used.
